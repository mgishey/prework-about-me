      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am here to update dormant coding skills and learn new ones so I can become a successful
        web developer. My coding experience is mainly in html and javascript with a little css thrown
        in. I have also written perl database interface scripts to communicate with an Oracle database
        from webpages.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived all over Arizona but mostly Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Motorcycles and flyfishing</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to create custom applications for Geographic Information Systems</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Tucson, AZ</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have had a taste of it and I feel it is something I could be good at. Making good
        money while doing something I enjoy is a bonus.
